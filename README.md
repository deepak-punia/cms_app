# Complaint Management Software


## [Web APP]( https://github.com/deepak-punia/complaint-management-software/)


Allow users to submit complaint with pictures.

Allow moderators to monitor all complaints.

Allow admin to monitor all complaints and users.

 

#### [Live Demo]( https://snack.expo.dev/@deepakpunia/cms_app)

 
Admin account - email: admin@admin.com password: password

Moderator account - email: mod@mod.com password: password

NOTE: Files are uploaded to the app but then disappear or are deleted after a while because heroku does not support file uploads that means that any changes to the filesystem whilst the dyno is running only last until that dyno is shut down or restarted. Each dyno boots with a clean copy of the filesystem from the most recent deploy.

## Features

- Separate dashboard for Users, Moderators and Admin.

- Flexible layout. Works on Andriod and IOS both.

- Admin can view data in charts on dashboard.

- Moderators can access all complaints.

 

## Backend is same for web app and mobile app.
